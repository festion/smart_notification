# Tag-Based Notification Routing - Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for enhancing the Smart Notification Router with tag-based routing capabilities.

## Phase 1: Foundation (2 weeks)

### Week 1: Core Tag Resolution System

#### Task 1.1: Tag Expression Parser
- Create a parser for tag expressions (`user:john+device:mobile`)
- Implement logical operations (AND, OR, NOT)
- Write unit tests for parser functionality

```python
# Sample implementation
class TagExpressionParser:
    def parse(self, expression):
        """Parse a tag expression into a structured representation.
        
        Args:
            expression (str): A tag expression like "user:john+device:mobile"
            
        Returns:
            dict: A structured representation of the expression
        """
        # Implementation
        pass
    
    def evaluate(self, expression, entity_tags):
        """Evaluate if an entity's tags match the expression.
        
        Args:
            expression (dict): Parsed expression
            entity_tags (list): List of tags for an entity
            
        Returns:
            bool: True if the entity matches the expression
        """
        # Implementation
        pass
```

#### Task 1.2: Home Assistant API Integration
- Create a client for the Home Assistant REST API
- Implement authentication with Long-Lived Access Tokens
- Build functions to query entities by tag

```python
# Sample implementation
class HomeAssistantClient:
    def __init__(self, base_url, access_token):
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.access_token = access_token
        self.headers = {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
    
    def get_entities_by_tag(self, tag):
        """Get entities with a specific tag.
        
        Args:
            tag (str): The tag to search for
            
        Returns:
            list: Entities with the specified tag
        """
        # Implementation
        pass
    
    def get_entity_state(self, entity_id):
        """Get the current state of an entity.
        
        Args:
            entity_id (str): Entity ID to get state for
            
        Returns:
            dict: Entity state
        """
        # Implementation
        pass
```

#### Task 1.3: Tag Resolution Service
- Implement service to resolve tag expressions to entities
- Create caching layer for performance optimization
- Add logging for resolution decisions

```python
# Sample implementation
class TagResolutionService:
    def __init__(self, ha_client, parser):
        self.ha_client = ha_client
        self.parser = parser
        self.cache = {}
        
    def resolve_expression(self, expression):
        """Resolve a tag expression to matching entities.
        
        Args:
            expression (str): A tag expression
            
        Returns:
            list: Matching entities
        """
        # Check cache
        if expression in self.cache:
            return self.cache[expression]
            
        # Parse expression
        parsed = self.parser.parse(expression)
        
        # Fetch entities with relevant tags
        entities = []
        # Implementation
        
        # Cache and return results
        self.cache[expression] = entities
        return entities
```

   - Risk: Medium
   - Mitigation: Implement version-specific API clients, monitor HA release notes

2. **Performance Degradation**:
   - Risk: Medium
   - Mitigation: Implement caching, optimize tag resolution, perform load testing

3. **Backward Compatibility Issues**:
   - Risk: Low
   - Mitigation: Maintain support for existing configurations, extensive testing

### Project Risks

1. **Scope Creep**:
   - Risk: High
   - Mitigation: Clear phase deliverables, regular progress tracking

2. **Integration Challenges**:
   - Risk: Medium
   - Mitigation: Early integration testing, collaboration with Home Assistant team

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - All tag-based routing features implemented and working
   - Backward compatibility maintained
   - Performance meets or exceeds existing system

2. **Non-Functional Requirements**:
   - Tag resolution completes in < 100ms
   - System handles 100+ notification requests per minute
   - UI response time < 200ms

3. **User Experience**:
   - Configuration process is intuitive
   - Tag expressions are easy to understand and create
   - System provides clear feedback on routing decisions

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to enhancing the Smart Notification Router with tag-based routing capabilities. By following this plan, we can deliver a more dynamic, context-aware notification system that leverages Home Assistant's entity relationships and provides a superior user experience.

The phased approach allows for incremental development and testing, with early delivery of core functionality and continuous refinement based on user feedback. The end result will be a notification system that automatically adapts to users' changing contexts and preferences, delivering notifications through the most appropriate channels at the most appropriate times.
